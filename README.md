Longitudinal integration database for health insurance and labour market studies (LISA by Swedish acronym)

During 2004 the longitudinal database LOUISE was extended and renamed LISA. Aside from Statistics Sweden, 
the Social Insurance Agency and the Swedish Agency for Innovative Systems partook in the construction work. 
The Social Insurance Agency is a continued cooperative partner in the further development and documentation of the database. 
The database presently holds annual registers since 1990 and includes all individuals 16 years of age and older that were 
registered in Sweden as of December 31 for each year. The database integrates existing data from the labour market, 
educational and social sectors and is updated each year with a new annual register. The individual is the primary object in 
LISA, but connections to family, companies and places of employment are also available. There are special retrieval tables for
companies and places of employment with descriptive data about the object.

The individual section of the database includes information on the following.

ethical screening is conducted in order to gain access to data for research purposes.
